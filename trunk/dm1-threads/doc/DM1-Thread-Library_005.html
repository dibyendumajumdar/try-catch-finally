<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">The DM1 Monitor is a thread synchronisation object similar to Microsoft .Net Monitor. It provides the combined functionality of a Mutex (mutual exclusion) and an Event (signal and wait) in one object.</P>

<H2>Permitted Operations</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">Lock - A thread may request a lock on a Monitor object. The 
  requesting thread blocks if the lock cannot be granted. The Lock request can 
  be nested, i.e., a Thread may request a Lock while holding it already. However, 
  each Lock request must have a corresponding Unlock request for the Monitor to 
  be eventually released.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Unlock - The thread that owns the Monitor may unlock the 
  Monitor, thereby making it available to other waiting threads. Unlock must be 
  called as many times as Lock was invoked.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Wait - A thread that owns a lock on the Monitor may wait 
  for a Signal by invoking one of the Wait functions. Wait relinquishes the lock 
  before going to sleep, and re-acquires the lock before returning to the caller. 
  Wait can be unconditional or conditional. A conditional wait allows a timeout 
  parameter to be specified if the condition is not signalled before the timeout 
  expires, the Wait returns false.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Notify - Sets the next waiting thread on a Monitor object 
  to Signalled state. If the Monitor lock is not being held, it is granted to 
  the oldest signalled thread. </P>
<P class="MsoNormal">NotifyAll - Sets all threads waiting on a Monitor object 
  to Signalled state. If the Monitor lock is not being held, it is granted to 
  the oldest signalled thread.</P>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">A Monitor object keeps references to following:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Mutex - A Mutex protects access to it.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Holder - Reference to the thread that holds a lock on the Monitor object.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">ReadyQ - A queue of threads eligible to acquire the lock.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">WaitQ - A queue of threads waiting to be signalled.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Lock - When a thread requests a Lock on the Monitor object, 
  one of three things can happen. If no one else is holding the lock (Holder is 
  null), then the lock is immediately granted and the requesting thread becomes 
  the lock holder. If the lock is already held by the requesting thread, then 
  the lock reference count is incremented. If some other thread is holding the 
  lock, then the requesting thread is added to the ReadyQ, and put to sleep. It 
  is woken up when the lock is granted, and control returns back to the caller.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Unlock - If the lock reference count is greater than 1, it 
  is decremented, and the Monitor is not unlocked. Otherwise, the Monitor lock 
  is granted to the first thread on the ReadyQ. This thread then becomes the lock 
  holder, and is removed from the ReadyQ.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Wait - The calling thread should have already locked the 
  Monitor object before invoking the Wait function. Wait puts the calling thread 
  on the WaitQ (with state set to Non-Signalled), and then releases the lock. 
  The Lock is granted to the first thread on the ReadyQ. The calling thread goes 
  to sleep until it is Signalled and subsequently woken up by another thread. 
  By the time the thread is woken up, it should have been set to Signalled state, 
  and it should have been granted the Lock. Thus, when the control is returned 
  back to the caller, the lock has been re-acquired.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Conditional Wait - A Conditional Wait is similar to a normal 
  Wait, but has a timeout associated with it. The calling thread should have already 
  locked the Monitor object before invoking the Conditional Wait function. Conditional 
  Wait puts the calling thread at the end of the WaitQ (with state set to Non-Signalled), 
  and then releases the lock. The Lock is granted to the first thread on the ReadyQ. 
  The calling thread goes to sleep until it is either Signalled and granted the 
  lock, or the sleep times out. In case of the timeout expiring, the thread must 
  re-acquire the lock before returning to the caller. To enable this, it is removed 
  from the WaitQ, and added to the ReadyQ. It then goes to sleep unconditionally, 
  waiting for the lock to be granted. When the lock is granted, it returns to 
  the caller with a return value of false , indicating that the wait timed out 
  while waiting for a Signal.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Notify - The caller does not need to lock the Monitor object. 
  The first thread on the WaitQ is set to Signalled state, and moved to the end 
  of ReadyQ. If no one is holding the lock (holder is null), then the first thread 
  on ReadyQ is granted the lock. Notify has no effect if there isn t any waiting 
  thread.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">NotifyAll - The caller does not need to lock the Monitor object. All threads on WaitQ are set to Signalled state and moved to the ReadyQ. If no one is holding the lock (Holder is null), then the first thread on ReadyQ is granted the lock. NotifyAll has no effect if there aren t any waiting threads.</P>

<H2>Features of a Monitor object</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">Since a Monitor lock is exclusive, Monitor objects can be used as a mechanism for Mutual Exclusion, in the same way as Mutexes. However, Mutexes are more efficient compared with Monitor objects. If Mutual Exclusion is all that you need, Mutexes are a better choice. If however, you need the ability to wait for a Monitor and the ability to signal other threads, then Monitor objects are a better choice.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Locks on a Monitor object are granted in FIFO order.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">When a thread waits on a Monitor object, it temporarily relinquishes the lock on the Monitor object. However, when control is returned to the thread, it is guaranteed that the lock would have been re-acquired.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Monitor objects and Events share some features. However, Events are more closely aligned to native Thread functionality of the Operating System. Monitors are a higher level implementation, and provide more predictable scheduling (locks are granted in FIFO order). While a DM1 Event supports notifying either one thread or all threads, a Monitor supports both types of notification. Finally, a Monitor object can be used for mutual exclusion, i.e., hence it is better suited for applications that require both Mutex and Event functionality in one object.</P>
