<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">The DM1 Thread object represents a native Operating System 
  thread. It provides a portable and simplified wrapper around Operating System 
  thread functionality. In addition to that, it supports rudimentary inter-thread 
  communication via signals.</P>

<H2>Usage</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">A DM1 Thread is instantiated using the ThreadFactory class. This is so that a Thread object can be automatically garbage collected once the thread has completed execution. When creating a Thread, you must provide a new instance of a Runnable object. The Runnable object should implement the run method which will form the main body of logic executed by the thread. The Runnable object must be allocated on the heap, and will be automatically deleted when the associated Thread object is garbage collected.</P>

<H2>The Runnable Object</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">A DM1 Thread executes the code implemented by a Runnable object. You should implement your own Runnable object by deriving from the Runnable class. The only method you will normally need to implement is the run method. Sometimes, you may choose to create a Thread object within the constructor of the Runnable object. Please refer to examples 1 and 2 for an illustration of these two techniques.</P>

<H2>The ThreadFactory Class</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">The ThreadFactory class provides a static method for creating new instances of the Thread class. The createThread method requires the following parameters:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A Runnable object allocated on the heap. You must not use the same Runnable object in more than one thread. You must not delete the Runnable object because it will be automatically deleted when the Thread finishes.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A name for the Thread. This is an optional parameter.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A Boolean value to indicate that the Thread should be created as a Daemon. A Daemon Thread need not be waited for. Threads that are not created as Daemons need to be waited for by joining with them. This parameter is optional, and its default value is false (i.e., Non Daemon).</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Please see examples 3 and 4 that illustrate how to create Daemon/Non-daemon threads.</P>

<H2>The Thread Object</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">Each Thread in the system is represented by a Thread object. Thread objects are created by the ThreadFactory class as described above.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Following operations are permitted on Thread objects:</P>

<H3>Permitted Operations</H3>

<P class="MsoNormal">Start - This creates an Operating System thread and executes 
  the code represented by the run method of the Runnable object associated with 
  that thread.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Wait - This causes the thread to go to sleep, waiting for 
  a Signal. Waits can be of two types: Conditional and Unconditional. A Conditional 
  Wait has a timeout associated with it. If the thread is not signalled before 
  the timeout expires, then the Wait returns with the error ETIMEDOUT. An Unconditional 
  Wait returns only when the thread has been signalled.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Notify - This sends a Signal to a waiting Thread.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Exit - This terminates the thread.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Join - Joining a thread causes the calling thread to block 
  until the joined thread completes. All Non-Daemon threads must be joined, because 
  until the thread is joined, its resources are not cleaned up.</P>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">Each Operating System thread is represented by a DM1 Thread 
  object. The Thread object contains a DM1 Event object to enable the Wait and 
  Notify functions. A Thread object is linkable; in fact, a Thread object contains 
  two sets of links. First set allows the thread to be attached to the wait queue 
  of a DM1 Latch or Monitor object. The second set of links allows the thread 
  to be linked to the list of threads maintained by the ThreadFactory class.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Creating a thread object does not automatically instantiate an Operating System thread. To do that, you need to invoke the Start method.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Thread objects must be created using the createThread method provided by the ThreadFactory class. When creating a Thread, a new instance of a Runnable object must be supplied.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The Wait and Notify methods are implemented using the Event object within the Thread object.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A special Thread object is created at start-up to represent the main thread. I make use of the C++ facility for instantiating static objects to ensure that this object is created before main() function is executed.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The Current Thread object can be retrieved at any time by looking up a pre-defined Thread Local Storage Key. This key is allocated at start-up, before main() is called. When a Thread starts executing, it updates the appropriate Thread Local Storage entry.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The ThreadFactory class maintains a linked list of allocated Threads. Every time a new Thread is created, it checks for Threads that have completed, and garbage collects them.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">At system shutdown, the ThreadFactory::shutdown method is invoked. This method waits for any Daemon Threads to complete, and then garbage collects all completed threads. It is an error if after the garbage collection there are any threads left on the system (this can happen if the application forgets to join with Non-Daemon threads).</P>
