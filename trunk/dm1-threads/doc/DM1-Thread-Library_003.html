<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">A DM1 Mutex enables a section of code to be executed by one 
  thread only at given a point in time. The Mutex is one of the fundamental thread 
  synchronisation primitives supported by an Operating System.</P>
<P class="MsoNormal">An AutoMutex class is provided. This is a helper class designed 
  to ensure that mutexes are released automatically when the program flow is broken 
  because of an Exception being thrown. The destructor of an AutoMutex object 
  automatically destroys the related Mutex object during stack unwinding.</P>

<H2>Operations</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">There are only two operations supported by the Mutex object.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Lock - This blocks the calling thread until the Mutex is 
  granted to the thread. Only one thread can own the Mutex at any point in time.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Unlock - Releases the Mutex and makes it available to other 
  threads.</P>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P class="MsoNormal">On Win32, a DM1 Mutex is implemented as a CRITICAL_SECTION. Since DM1 does not support inter-process synchronisation, it does not require the greater flexibility and overhead of a Win32 Mutex.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">On UNIX, a DM1 Mutex is implemented as a pthread_mutex object.</P>

<H2>API</H2>

namespace dm1 { 
 
        class Mutex { 
 
        public:

                explicit Mutex();

                 * blocked until the Mutex lock is granted. 
                 * Recursive calls are not supported. 
                 */ 
                void lock(); 
 
                /** 
                 * Unlocks the Mutex object. Caller must hold the  
                 * lock before calling unlock. 
                 */ 
                void unlock(); 
        }; 
 
        class AutoMutex { 
        public: 
                explicit AutoMutex(Mutex *mutex) ; 
                ~AutoMutex() ; 
                void lock() ; 
                void unlock() ; 
        };
