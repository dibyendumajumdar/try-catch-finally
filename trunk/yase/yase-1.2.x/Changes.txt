Added new filter (yasewvcnv) to convert output from WvHtml to XML format.

8-10 May 2002

Added new filter for converting HTML files to XML format

11 May 2002

Disk on my PC crashed. Lost changes related to inlining of functions.

12 May 2002

Ported to Win32 (excluding wget and libxml).
Inlined some btree, bitfile, and compress functions.

24 May 2002

Built yasemakedb with wget and libxml support on Win32.

15 Nov 2002

Fixed compilation problems on Linux caused by the win32 port.

21 Nov 2002

Fixed memory allocation bug in alloc.c.

28 Nov 02

Started conversion to C++. Initially, recompiled everything as C++.

29 Nov 02

Created new class BitFile - replacing old ys_bitfile_t.

02 Dec 02

Created new class PorterStemmer.

03 Dec 02

Fixed bug in Btree (ys_block_set_curkey).

04 Dec 02

Created new class PostFile representing Postings. This hides the implementation
details of the Postings file.

Started reading/thinking about how to implement ranking in boolean queries.

06 Dec 02

Created new file formulas.h and moved all the logic for calculating IDF, etc.
to this file.

Released 1.0.0b and 1.0.8a containing Btree bug-fix.

07 Dec 02

Created new class Collection. 

Create new files docweights.[hc]. This implements the new routines for calculating document weights. The new method works post index creation - this 
enables it to use more statistics, such as maxtf and maxdtf. Still need per 
document max term frequency for some of the formulas.

Changed version number to 1.1.0 - this is to mark the transition to C++.

08 Dec 02

Added support for storing max term frequency per document. This allows the document term frequency to
be normalised when calculating document term weight.

Document weights are now calculated after the BTree index has been built. New module docweights.cpp.

10 Dec 02

New class Search to represent an abstract search class.
New classes SearchResultSet and SearchResultItem.

18 Dec 02

New class RankedSearch to represent Ranked queries. 

25 Dec 03

New class BooleanSearch to represent Boolean searches.

31 Dec 02

Tokenizer module rewrite. New StringTokenizer class. 

01 Jan 03

Support for extracting ascii text from UTF-8 source.

02 Jan 03

Search classes modified to use tokenizers. With this change, all input parsing is done
using tokenizers.

04 Jan 03

New classes SaxParser, HtmlParser and XmlParser - converted from code in getword.cpp.

07 Jan 03

StringTokenizer and derivatives converted to templates.

13 Jan 03

New file globals.cpp to define Ys_debug.

12-22 Jan 03

New classes to manage input and output. 
QueryForm represents the input Form.
QueryInput is an abstract class that represents the input stream.
QueryOutput is an abstract class that represents the output stream.
QueryAction is responsible for executing queries.
WebInput is a derived class that implements CGI input.
HtmlOutput is a derived class that implements HTML output.
ConsoleOutput is a derived class that implements simple text output (this is incomplete).

23 Jan 03

New class Properties.

26 Jan 03

New class YaseQuery encapsulates the yasequery functionality. Only
CGI Input and HTML Output is provided.

27 Jan 03

All classes now belong to namespace yase.
