<h1>Things to do</h1>

<p>YASE is work in progress - therefore many features are planned but have not 
  yet made it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>64-bit file input/output for YASE database files. This is to support very 
    large databases.</li>
  <li>Ability to add documents to an existing collection. Currently the database 
    needs to be rebuilt if the document collection changes.</li>
  <li>Query processing logic can be improved to handle cases where a large number 
    of documents are selected. YASE tries to retrieve everything - which can take 
    quite a while if the collection is large and the query selects a large majority 
    of documents.</li>
  <li>All data is currently stored in files. I would like to provide the alternative 
    of using a DBMS (such as Oracle) for data storage. </li>
  <li>Need to compress the data stored in yase.files and yase.docs.</li>
  <li>Would like to provide a facility for storing the first few sentences of 
    a document so that when query results are displayed, the user can be given 
    an idea of the content of the document. This will have to be stored in a compressed 
    form.</li>
  <li>Currently, the query tool is a CGI program. Would like to build a Servlet 
    interface to the query tool. I would like to convert the existing query tool 
    (yasequery) to a multi-threaded query server, using a socket to link the Java 
    Servlet to the server. This would not only improve performance but also make 
    YASE more scalable.</li>
</ul>
