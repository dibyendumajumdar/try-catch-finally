<h1>Compression</h1>

<pre class="text">The list of document numbers needs to be stored in a compressed form&nbsp;
in the yase.postings file.

First of all, instead of storing absolute document numbers, gaps between
document numbers can be stored. Secondly the numbers can be stored in
a compressed form such as described below:

Unary encoding
--------------
An integer x (>= 1) is coded as x-1 one bits followed by a zero bit.
Example 3 = 110.

Gamma encoding
--------------
The number x is stored as a unary code for 1+log(x) followed by a code of
log(x) bits that represent the value x-2^log(x) in binary. The unary part
specifies how many bits are required to code x, and then the binary part
actually codes x in that many bits. Example:
x = 9. log(x)=3, so 3+1=4 is encoded in unary code (1110) followed
by 9-2^3=9-8=1 as a binary log(x)=3 bits (001).

Local Bernoulli using Golumb coding
-----------------------------------
N = Documents
f = frequency
b = .69 * N/f

The number x is stored in two parts: first q + 1 in unary, where
quotient q = (x-1)/b. Then the remainder r = x - (q*b) - 1 in binary.

Example x = 9, b = 3. q = (9-1)/3 = 2. r = 9 - (2*3) - 1 = 2. Therefore,
first q = 2 is code as 110, followed by r = 2 as 11.

In the list [8;3,5,20,21,23,76,77,78] N=78, f=8, b=6.
