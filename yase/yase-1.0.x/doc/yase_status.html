YASE Modification Log
</h1>

<pre class="text">
21 Nov 2002
Fixed hideous bug in alloc.c introduced in release 1.0 (alas).

15 Nov 2002
Fixed compilation problems on Linux caused by the win32 port.

24 May 2002
Built yasemakedb with wget and libxml support on Win32.

12 May 2002
Ported to Win32 (excluding wget and libxml).
Inlined some btree, bitfile, and compress functions.

11 May 2002
Disk on my PC crashed. Lost changes related to inlining of functions.

8-10 May 2002
Added new filter for converting HTML files to XML format

5-6 May 2002
Added support for wvToolkit.
Added word2xml.sh.
Added new filter (yasewvcnv) to convert output from WvHtml to XML format.

15-20 Feb 2002
* Changed boolean query parser to accept "and", "or", and 
  "not" keywords instead of &amp;, | and ! characters.
* Fixed problems related to handling filenames/urls 
  containing spaces. When storing a url, YASE now
  decodes any special characters. When outputing a hyperlink, 
  YASE now encodes url unsafe characters as hex sequences. 
* Introduced global variable Ys_debug to control debug 
  message output.
* Changed the delimiter in YASE files from % to ^. This is 
  because % character is used to start hex sequences in 
  URLs.
* When executing filters, YASE now encloses the filename 
  argument in quotes - this allows filters to work
  on filenames that have embedded spaces.
* YASE tested with catdoc and pdftotext, both in local 
  file-system mode, and http mode.
* New script pdf2text created as a front-end to pdftotext. 
  pdftotext cannot send output to stdout - the script 
  saves the output to a temporary file and then dumps it 
  to stdout.
* Introduced html templates - the output from yasequery 
  can now be customised.
* Introduced new navigation menu - query results page 
  now supports customisable first, next, prev and last page 
  buttons.
* yasequery now recognises short names for all of its 
  input variables.
* YASE now generates output in XML format when running in 
  text mode.
* YASE distribution made smaller by removing some unsed
  components of LIBXML and WGET.
* YASE upgraded to use libxml2-2.4.15.
* YASE Makefile fixed so that version.h is recreated when
  building YASE.

16 Nov 2001
* Fixed portability problems in ys_file_setpos() and ys_file_getpos().
* Fixed incorrect use of va_start() in ys_file_printf().

25 Aug 2001
* Renamed most of global functions in YASE to avoid conflicts with names
  used in system header files.

16 Apr 2001
* Completed an implementation of boolean query. Turned out to be much easier
  than I thought it would be.
* Updated documentation to reflect above.

08 Apr 2001
* YASE now uses the configure utility to ease the make process.
* A small xml/html parser written. In future I plan to use this rather than
  libxml because I don't really need all the functionality in libxml.
* Documentation updated, and modified to use stylesheets.

25 Nov 2000
* Finally started work on YASE again after a long break.
* Introduced the concept of logicalname in docdb functions.
* Completed first cut integration with wget. For this purpose,
  transformed wget into a library.
* Updated documentation to reflect the fact that YASE can now
  index web sites.

29 Oct 2000
* Introduced the concept of logicalname in document_process().

8 Oct 2000
* Started work on integrating wget with YASE. Port to Windows has taken a 
  back seat as I want to first introduce the ability to index web sites
  via http. To do this, I hope to make use of the GNU utility wget.
  I chose wget after looking at several other products - primarily because
  I liked the code quality. wget is modular and well written.

7 July 2000

* Re-introduced the ability to insert keys into the BTree.
* Created a test harness for BTree.
* Fixed a bug in btree_foreach().
* Changed the licensing notice within the source files from LGPL to GPL.
* Corrected reference to Web site in the source files.

28 June 2000

* Started work on version 0.9 which will contain:
  + Ability to add documents to an existing collection
  + Port to Windows 98
  + More documentation

27 June 2000

* First public release - version 0.8.12

24-25 June 2000

* Documentation updates.
* Renamed makedb to yasemakedb and query to yasequery.
* Renamed indexdump to yaseindexdump and index to yaseindex.
* Changed Makefile so that only yasemakedb and yasequery are built by
  default.
* Changed Makefile to copy contents of test to installation directory.

5-13 May 2000

* Changed getword.c to setup environment variables (YASE_FILENAME,
  YASE_SIZE, YASE_DATECREATED, YASE_TITLE) when executing filters
* Added 'Alice in Wonderland' text for testing.
* Created filter txt2xml.awk for processing above.
* More documentation updates.
* Stream-lined code, eliminated globals from extract.c.
* Added ystdio module.

2-4 May 2000

* Mainly documentation updates and cleanup

29-Apr-2000

* Added ability to accept xml input from user defined filters
* Query output now displays hits against each term being searched

27-Apr-2000

* Ranked query support completed
* Query input parsing modified to break up terms in the same way as
  the Indexing algorithms

26-Apr-2000

* Added support for ranked queries - still incomplete

21-Apr-2000 to 25-Apr-2000

* Resumed work after a long break
* Added support for piping filters when processing user defined document 
  types
* Started using the libxml 2.0.0 library to enable xml parsing
* Added support for parsing html documents
* Added support for multiple documents in a single file. Changes to file
  formats - please see yase_files.html for more information.
* New file called yase.files added. See yase_files.html.
* Added document weight to yase.docptrs. See yase_ranking.html for more
  details.
* docdb.[hc] virtually re-written
* getword.c has major changes to it

23-Jan-2000

* Enabled support for user defined document types.

19-Jan-2000

* wasn't sure whether it is more efficient to store document offets in
  yase.postings or document numbers. finally added support to store
  document numbers - document offsets can be worked out by looking up
  a new file yase.docptrs. to my surprise overall compression improved
  dramatically when using gamma encoding. presumably gamma encoding is
  more suitable for small numbers.

* also added support for storing term frequency with each term. originally
  i had no plans of adding support for ranked queries but following 
  discussions with ian northeast have changed my mind.

* created new module docdb.c for manipulating yase.docs and yase.docptrs
  files. this has improved the design by hiding details of these files.

* fixed a bug in extract which was causing the first document in 
  yase.docs to be excluded from the database.

* current set of commands are:
    makedb - create a database
    query - query a database
    index - recreates yase.btree 
    indexdump - dumps yase.btree 

* current set of files are:
    yase.btree - index used by query
    yase.postings - postings file 
    yase.docs - list of documents in the database
    yase.docptrs - pointers to documents in yase.docs. each pointer is
       a long offset into the file yase.docs.
    yase.words - intermediate file required to create the btree.

18-Jan-2000

* renamed command extract to makedb. it now creates yase.btree as
  well.
* changed logic for identifying binary files.

17-Jan-2000

* indexdump was broken - fixed.
* New interface for extract allows user to specify database path, root path,
  and memory limit. Root path option allows document references to be relative.
* extract can now process any number of directories.
* index can be given the database path as an argument.
* query enhanced to allow exact match.
* query enhanced to default collection path.
* search.html enhanced to allow exact match.
* query now locates the database relative to DOCUMENT_ROOT.

16-Jan-2000

* Internal revision mainly - see yase_modules.html for more details.
* query 'match all terms' was broken - fixed.
* query enhanced to process both web queries and queries on stdin.

15-Jan-2000

* extract modified to store gaps between offsets rather
  than pure offsets because pure offsets do not compress well.

14-Jan-2000

* wquery interface enhanced to allow matching of any or all search terms.

13-Jan-2000

* Created search.html

* Created wquery - the cgi program that can process queries submitted
  from search.html. This is a modified version of query.

12-Jan-2000

* First cut of the indexer completed yesterday. Produces yase.btree.
  In the process created block io sub-system.

* First cut of indexdump utility completed yesterday.

* First cut of query completed today. Supports search for one or more
  words  - prefix match. Documents matching are returned.

* The product now consists of 4 utilities:
  extract: scans a directory and produces 3 files:
     yase.docs - list of documents
     yase.postings - document lists for each keyword
     yase.words - sorted list of keywords/pointer to postings ready to be fed 
        to the Btree
  index: scans yase.words and produces yase.btree.
  indexdump: dumps yase.btree for debugging purposes.
  query: performs searches and returns documents matching the query.

08-Jan-2000

* Coded Btree creation/insertion. Memory based still - need to add file
  IO. Keys and values are compressed.

* First cut of the keyword Extractor completed. Produces three files after
  processing a directory structure:
     yase.docs - list of documents
     yase.postings - document lists for each keyword
     yase.words - sorted list of keywords/pointer to postings ready to be fed 
        to the Btree
