<h1>YASE Concepts</h1>

<p>
YASE consists of two basic tools. The yasemakedb tool creates a YASE database.
The yasequery tool allows users to submit queries which are then processed and
results are displayed to the user.
</p>

<p>
The yasemakedb tool processes a set of directories or web sites by recursively
scanning each directory or web site. Files are read after any preprocessing 
(in case a filter was specified) and terms (words) extracted. These terms are 
then stored in an index. For each term, a list of documents is maintained. 
This list is stored in the postings file. Conceptually, once yasemakedb has 
finished, we end up with an index (sorted list of terms) and for each term, 
lists of documents. Some details about the documents themselves are also 
stored for easy reference.
</p>

<p>
The yasequery tool accepts a list of terms from the user and scans the index
for these terms. Any terms found in the index are said to be matched, and
yasequery then retrieves the document lists associated with the matched terms.
The documents are sorted by their rank (relevance to the query) if necessary.
The results (list of documents) are then shown to the user.
