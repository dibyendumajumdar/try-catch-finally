<h1>YASE BTree index</h1>

<p>
YASE implements the index as a btree. Terms are stored in sorted order,
along with frequency (number of documents the term occurs in) and an offset
into the postings file. 
</p>

<p>
The design of the btree (implemented in btree.h and btree.c) is described here.
</p>

<h2>
Structure of a node
</h2>

<p>
Each node in the tree contains a list of entries. An entry consists of
a <tt>key</tt>, a <tt>value</tt> and document count (<tt>doccnt</tt>), and optionally a pointer to a child node (<tt>ptrchild</tt>).The <tt>ptrchild</tt> is not necessary in leaf nodes.<p>

<p>
The indexed term is stored as the <tt>key</tt>, the file offset in the postings file (<tt>yase.postings</tt>) is the stored as <tt>value</tt>, and the term frequency (i.e. number of documents the term appears in) is stored as <tt>doccnt</tt>.
</p>

<p>
An extra <tt>ptrchild</tt> is stored with each node - in inner nodes, this points to the child node containing keys alphabetically smaller than the first key in the node. In leaf nodes this is set to 0.
</p>

<p>
Logically, a btreenode may be represented by a C structure as follows:

<pre class="code">
struct entry;

struct btreenode {
	unsigned short flags;
	unsigned short freespace;
	unsigned short no_of_entries;
	long ptrchild;
	struct entry array_of_entries[no_of_entries];
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Each node maintains an entry count - which is equal to the number of
entries in the node, and freespace, which tracks the amount of freespace in
the node.
</p>

<h2>
Compression
</h2>

<p>
Entries in the node are stored in a compressed form. The format used can
be represented as a C structure as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
struct {
 unsigned char prefix_len;
 unsigned char key_len;
 unsigned ptrchild_len : 4;
 unsigned value_len    : 4;
 unsigned doccnt_len   : 4;             /* 0 if doccnt_len &lt;= 0x0f */
 unsigned doccnt       : 4;             /* 0 if doccnt_len &gt; 0x0f  */
 unsigned char key[key_len];
 unsigned char ptrchild[ptrchild_len];
 unsigned char value[value_len];
 unsigned char doccnt[doccnt_len];      /* used if doccnt_len &gt; 0x0f */
}
</pre>

<p>
prefix_len tracks the number of bytes a key has common with its
predecessor.
</p>

<p>
key_len tracks the size of the key (excluding prefix) in bytes.
</p>

<p>
value_len tracks the number of bytes used to store value.
</p>

<p>
ptrchild_len tracks the number of bytes used to store a ptrchild.
</p>

<p>
doccnt_len tracks the number of bytes used to store a doccnt. If it is 0, 
then doccnt is less than or equal to 0x0f (15) and is stored in the next
four bits. If it is &gt; 0, then doccnt is &gt; 0x0f (15) and is stored
at the end of the entry in the same way value and ptrchild are stored.
</p>

<p>
Above scheme allows most term frequencies to be stored in a single byte 
of storage.
</p>

<p>
Value, doccnt (if &gt; 0x0f) and ptrchild are stored in reverse byte order 
in binary form. Only significant bytes are stored. No space is used if value or
ptrchild is equal to 0 - thus leaf nodes do not consume any space
for ptrchild fields. Term frequency (doccnt) can never be 0.
</p>

<h2>
Maximum key size
</h2>

<p>
The maximum length of a key is 254. This is because the length of
the key is stored in an 'unsigned char'.
</p>

<h2>
Trailing spaces in keys
</h2>

<p>
Trailing spaces are significant. Ofcourse, the calling application can and
should remove any trailing spaces from a key. This is what YASE does.
</p>

<h2>
Case sensitivity
</h2>

<p>
Key comparison is case sensistive. Caller can case convert the key to either
upper case or lower case and achieve case insensitivity. YASE converts all
keys to lower case.
</p>

<h2>
Duplicate keys
</h2>

<p>
At this point duplicate keys are not allowed.
I may add support for this later.
</p>

<h2>
Building a tree
</h2>

<p>
A tree is built from bottom up. A sorted list of keys and values is required
as input. First the leaf nodes are built, then the parent nodes, then
grand-parent nodes, and so on until the root node is built. As each level
is built, keys for the higher level are stored in a temporary file.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: The last node on any level may end up containing zero keys.
</p>
<p>
YASE uses merge-sort algorithm to build the initial sorted list of
terms. Terms are read into a balanced binary search tree,
and when a predefined memory limit is reached, the tree is
merged with data from previous passes into a temporary file.
</p>

<h2>
Some important points regarding nodes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
A node always maintains a pointer to the current key.
</li>
<li>
The pointer to current key ranges from 1 to keycount+1 - when the pointer is 
at keycount+1 it means we are past the last key and therefore at EOF.
An empty node always has the pointer set to 1 - which given that
keycount is 0, means EOF.
</li>
<li>
At run-time list of key offsets is maintained for each node so that we 
can move from one key to the next quickly.
</li>
<li>
We cannot binary search the keys in a node because the keys are stored
in compressed form, and that prevents us from reading a key at random.
</li>
<li>
We can only move forward when reading keys from a node (again because
of compression). To move back we have to start from the beginning.
</li>
<li>
The cost of sequential access is offset by the disk savings achieved
due to compression. Disk IO is far more expensive than memory based
scanning.
</li>
<li>
The node size is fixed at 8K, and maximum keysize is 254 bytes.
</li>
<li>
The minimum length of an entry is about 5 bytes (4 bytes prologue and
1 byte of data). The total key space is about 8182 bytes, thus around
1634 keys can be stored in a single node (at maximum compression).
</li>
<li>
blocknumbers are not file offsets - to get a file offset, you have to
multiply blocknumber-1 with BLOCKSIZE which is 8K.
</li>
</ul>
