Introduction
------------
This paper outlines the high-level design of an Information Retrieval
System called YASE. YASE stands for Yet Another Search Engine.

The following points are important with regards to the proposed design.

1. The design should be such that enormous volumes of data can be 
   processed efficiently - both in terms of memory and space.

2. Retrieval should be very quick.

3. For the puposes of this product a document is any file from which 
   words can be extracted by a suitable filter.

4. Searches will result in a list of documents which match the search
   criteria - there will not be any attempt to provide a finer level of
   granularity.

Proposed Design
---------------
The product will consist of the following components:

1. Document Locator. This sub-system will be reponsible for
   accepting new documents to the collection. The system will maintain
   a list of references to documents - no attempt will be made to 
   modify the location or format of the document. An existing directory
   structure can be used as the document source.
   Each document will be identified by a document number.

2. Keyword Extractor. This sub-system will be responsible for scanning a
   document for keywords. Optional features will be:
  
   2.1 Use of an exclusion list.
   2.2 Ability to fold case.
   2.3 Ability to extract the 'stem' of a word.

   The extractor will recognise several types of documents.
   * text files
   * compressed (gzip or compress or pkzip) text files
   * tar archives of text files
   * compressed (gzip or compress or pkzip) tar archives of text files
   * html pages
   * amipro documents (may be compressed)
   * word documents (may be compressed)
   * pdf documents (may be compressed)
   * postscript documents (may be compressed)

   Initially only text files will be supported.

   Data output from this tool will be fed to the Indexer utility described
   below.

3. Indexer. This sub-system will be responsible for generating the
   Index for the collection. There will be two variations of this
   program:

   3.1 Full index build. This will build the complete index from scratch,
   destroying any previous index.

   3.2 Incremental build. This will allow addition of new documents to
   an existing collection.

   The Index format will be a compressed B-Tree.
   Only keys will be stored in the index; the actual list of documents
   will be accessed indirectly through a Pointer to another file containing
   document lists.

4. Query Analyzer. This sub-system will allow the user to submit queries and
   retrieve results. It will have the following features:

   4.1 Ability to locate documents containing any one of the given terms.
   4.2 Ability to locate documents containing all of the given terms.
   4.3 Ability to execute boolean queries.

   The input to the tool will be provided via stdin in a form that might
   be easily generated by a front-end tool.

   The result of a query will be a formatted list of documents in a form
   that can be readily used interpreted by a front-end tool. 

   A socket interface will also be provided.

5. Web Interface. This will be a CGI sub-system that can be used at a 
   website to query the document archive.
